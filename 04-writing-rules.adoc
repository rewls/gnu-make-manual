= 4 Writing Rules
:toc: left
:source-highlighter: rouge

* A _rule_ appears in the makefile and says when and how to remake certain
  files, called the rule's _targets_.
* It lists the other files that are the _prerequisites_ of the target, and the
  _recipe_ to use to create or update the target.

'''

* The order of rules is not significant, except for determining the _default
  goal_: the target for `make` to consider, if you do not otherwise specify
  one.
* The default goal is the first target of the first rule in the first makefile.
* There are two exceptions: a target starting with a period is not a default
  unless it also contains one or more slashes, \'``/``'; and, a target that
  defines a pattern rule has no effect on the default goal.
* (See Section 10.5 [Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules].)

'''

* Therefore, we usually write the makefile so that the first rule is the one
  for compiling the entire program or all the programs described by the
  makefile (often with a target called \'``all``').
* See Section 9.2 [Arguments to Specify the Goals].

== 4.1 Rule Syntax

* In general, a rule looks like this:
+
[source,makefile,subs=+quotes]
_targets_: _prerequisites_
	_recipe_
	...

* or like this:
+
[source,makefile,subs=+quotes]
_targets_: _prerequisites_; _recipe_
	_recipe_
	...

* The _targets_ are file names, seperated by spaces.
* Wildcard characters may be used +
  (see Section 4.3 [Using Wildcard Characters in File Names])
  and a name of the form `_a_(_m_)` represents member _m_ in archive file _a_ +
  (see Section 11.1 [Archive Members as Targets]).
* Usually there is only one target per rule, but occasionally there is a reason
  to have more +
  (see Section 4.9 [Multiple Targets in a Rule]).

'''

* The _recipe_ lines start with a tab character.
* The first recipe line may appear on the line after the prerequisites, with a
  tab character, or may appear on the same line, with a semicolon.
* Either way, the effect is the same.
* There are other differences in the syntax of recipes.
* See Chapter 5 [Writing Recipes in Rules].

'''

* Because dollar signs are used to start `make` variable references, if you
  really want to a dollar sign in a target or prerequisite you must write two
  of them, \'``$$`' +
  (see Chapter 6 [How to Use Variables]).
* If you have enabled secondary expansion and you want a literal dollar sign in
  the prerequisites list, you must actually write _four_ dollar sign
  (\'``$$$$``').

'''

* You may split a long line by inserting a backslash followed by a newline, but
  this is not required, as `make` places no limit on the length of a line in a
  makefile.

'''

* A rule tells `make` two things: when the targets are out of date, and how to
  update them when necessary.

'''

* The criterion for being out of date is specified in terms of the
  _prerequisites_, which consist of file names separated by spaces.
* (Wildcards and archive members +
  (see Chapter 11 [Archives]) +
  are allowed here too.)
* A target is out of date if it does not exist or if it is older than any of
  the prerequisites.

'''

* How to update is specified by a _recipe_.
* This is one or more lines to be executed by the shell, but with some extra
  features +
  (see Chapter 5 [Writing Recipes in Rules]).

== 4.2 Types of Prerequisites

* There are two different types of prerequisites understood by GNU `make`:
  normal prerequisites, described in the previous section, and _order-only_
  prerequisites.
* A normal prerequisite makes two statements: first, it imposes an order in
  which recipes will be invoked: the recipes for all prerequisites of a target
  will be completed before the recipe for the target is started.
* Second, it imposes a dependency relationship: if any prerequisite is newer
  than the target, then the target is considered out-of-date and must be
  rebuilt.

'''

* Occasionally you may want to ensure that a prerequisite is built before a
  target, but _without_ forcing the target to be updated if the prerequisite is
  updated.
* _Order-only_ prerequisites are used to create this type of relationship.
* Order-only prerequisites can be specified by placing a pipe symbol (`|`) in
  the prerequisites list: any prerequisites to the left of the pipe symbol are
  normal; any prerequisites to the right are order-only:
+
[source,makefile,subs=+quotes]
_targets_ : _normal-prerequisites_ | _order-only-prerequisites_

'''

* The normal prerequisites section may of course be empty.
* Also, you may still declare multiple lines of prerequisites for the same
  target: they are appended appropriately (normal prerequisites are appended to
  the list of normal prerequisites; order-only prerequisites are appended to
  the list of order-only prerequisites).
* Note that if you declare the same file to be both a normal and an order-only
  prerequisite, the normal prerequisite takes precedence (since they have a
  strict superset of the behavior of an order-only prerequisite).

'''

* Order-only prerequisites are never checked when determining if the target is
  out of date; even order-only prerequisites marked as phony (see Section 4.5
  [Phony Targets], page 31) will not cause the target to be rebuilt.

'''

* Consider an example where your targets are to be placed in a separate
  directory, and that directory might not exist before `make` is run.
* In this situation, you want the directory to be created before any targets
  are placed into it but, because the timestamps on directories change where a
  file is added, removed, or renamed, we certainly don't want to rebuild all the
  targets whenever the directory's timestamp changes.
* One way to manage this is with order-only prerequisites: make the directory
  an order-only prerequisite on all the targets:
+
[,makefile]
----
OBJDIR := objdir
OBJS := (addprefix $(OBJDIR)/,foo.o bar.o baz.o)

$(OBJDIR)/%.o : %.c
	$(COMPILE.c) $(OUTPUT_OPTION) $<

all: $(OBJS)

$(OBJS): | $(OBJDIR)

$(OBJDIR):
	mkdir $(OBJDIR)
----

'''

* Now the rule to create the `objdir` directory will be run, if needed, before
  any, before any '.o' is built, but no '.o' will be built because the `objdir`
  directory timestamp changed.

== 4.3 Using Wildcard Characters in File Names

* A single file name can specify many files using *_wildcard_ characters*.
* The wildcard characters in `make` are \'``*``', \'``?``' and \'``[...]``',
  the same as in the Bourne shell.

'''

* If an expression matches multiple files then the results will be sorted.
* However multiple expressions will not be globally sorted.

'''

* The character \'``~``' at the beginning of a file name also has special
  significance.
* If alone, or followed by a slash, it represents your home directory.
* If the \'``~``' is followed by a word, the string represents the home
  directory of the use named by that word.

'''

* Wildcard expansion is performed by `make` automatically in targets and in
  prerequisites.
* In recipes, the shell is responsible for wildcard expansion.
* In other contexts, wildcard expansion happens only if you request it
  explicitly with the `wildcard` function.

'''

* The special significance of a wildcard characters can be turned off by
  preceding it with a backslash.

=== 4.3.1 Wildcard Examples

* With the following rule in the makefile, \'``make print``' will print all the
  \'``.c``' files that have changed since the last time you printed them:
+
[source,makefile]
print: *.c
	lpr -p $?
	touch print

* This rule uses `print` as an empty target file; see Section 4.7 [Empty Target
  Files to Record Events].
* (The automatic variable \'``$?``' is used to print only those files that have
  changed; see Section 10.5.3 [Automatic Variables].)

=== 4.3.3 The Function `wildcard`

* Wildcard expansion does not normally take place when a variable is set, or
  inside the arguments of a function.
* If you want to do wildcard expansion in such places, you need to use the
  `wildcard` function, like this:
+
[source,makefile,subs=+quotes]
$(wildcard _pattern_...)

* This string, used anywhere in a makefile, is replaced by a space-separated
  list of names of existing files that match one of the given file name
  patterns.
* If no existing file name matches a pattern, then that pattern is omitted from
  the output of the `wildcard` function.
* The results of the `wildcard` function are sorted.
* Each individual expression is sorted separately.

'''

* We can change the list of C source files into a list of object files by
  replacing the '`.c`' suffix with '`.o`' in the result, like this:
+
[source,makefile]
$(patsubst %.c,%.o,$(wildcard *.c))

* (See Section 8.2 [Functions for String Substitution and Analysis].)

'''

* Thus, a makefile to compile all C source files in the directory and then link
  them together could be written as follows:
+
[,makefile]
----
objects := $(patsubst %.c,%.o,$(wildcard *.c))

foo: $(objects)
	cc -o foo $(objects)
----

* See Section 6.2 [The Two Flavors of Variables] for an explanation of
  \'``:=``', which is a variant of \'``=``'.

== 4.5 Phony Targets

* A phony target is one that is not really the name of a file; rather it is
  just a name for a recipe to be executed when you make an explicit request.
* There are two reasons to use a phony target: to avoid a conflict with a file
  of the same name, and to improve performance.

'''

* If you write a rule whose recipe will not create the target file, the recipe
  will be executed every time the target comes up for remaking.
* Here is an example:
+
[source,makefile]
clean:
	rm *.o temp

* In this example, the `clean` target will not work properly if a file named
  `clean` is ever created in this directory.
* Since it has no prerequisites, `clean` would always be considered up to date
  and its recipe would not be executed.
* To avoid this problem you can explicitly declare the target to be phony by
  making it a prerequisite of the special target `.PHONY` +
  (see Section 4.8 [Special Built-in Target Names]) as follows:
+
[source,makefile]
.PHONY: clean
clean:
	rm *.o temp

* Once this is done, \'``make clean``' will run the recipe regardless of
  whether there is a file named `clean`.

'''

* Prerequisites of `.PHONY` are always interpreted as literal target names,
  never as patterns.

'''

* Phony targets are also useful in conjunction with recursive invocations of
  `make` (see Section 5.7 [Recursive Use of `make`]).

== 4.7 Empty Target Files to Record Events

* The empty target is a variant of the phony target; it is used to hold recipes
  for an action that you request explicitly from time to time.
* Unlike a phony target, this target file can really exist; but the file's
  contents do not matter, and usually are empty.

'''

* The purpose of the empty target file is to record, with its last-modification
  time, when the rule's recipe was last executed.
* It does so because one of the commands in the recipe is a `touch` command to
  update the target file.

'''

* The empty target file should have some prerequisites (otherwise it doesn't
  make sense).
* When you ask to remake the empty target, the recipe is executed if any
  prerequisite is more recent than the target; in other words, if a
  prerequisite has changed since the last time you remade the target.
* Here is an example:
+
[source,makefile]
print: foo.c bar.c
	lpr -p $?
	touch print

* With this rule, \'``make print``' will execute the `lpr` command if either
  source file has changed since the last \'``make print``'.
* The automatic variable \'``$?``' is used to print only those files that have
  changed (see Section 10.5.3 [Automatic Variables]).

== 4.9 Multiple Targets in a Rule

* When an explicit rule has multiple targets they can be treated in one of two
  possible ways: as independent targets or as grouped targets.
* The manner in which they are treated is determined by the separator that
  appears after the list of targets.

=== Rules with Independent Targets

* Rules that use the standard target separator, `:`, define independent
  targets.
* This is equivalent to writing the same rule once for each target, with
  duplicated prerequisites and recipes.
* Typically, the recipe would use automatic variables such as \'``$@``' to
  specify which target is being built.

'''

* Rules with independent targets are useful in two cases:
** You want just prerequisites, no recipe. +
   For example:
+
[source,makefile]
kbd.o command.o files.o: command.h
+
gives an additional prerequisite to each of the three object files
mentioned. +
It is equivalent to writing:
+
[source,makefile]
kbd.o: command.h
command.o: command.h
files.o: command.h

** Similar recipes work for all the targets. +
   The automatic variable \'``$@``' can be used to substitute the particular
   target to be remade into the commands (see Section 10.5.3 [Automatic
   Variables], page 130). +
   For example:
+
[source,makefile]
bigoutput littleoutput : text.g
	generate text.g -$(subst output,,$@) > $@
+
is equivalent to
+
[source,makefile]
bigoutput : text.g
	generate text.g -big > bigoutput
littleoutput : text.g
	generate text.g -little > littleoutput
+
Here we assume the hypothetical program `generate` makes two types of output,
one if given \'``-big``' and one if given \'``-little``'. +
See Section 8.2 [Functions for String Substitution and Analysis], page 92, for
an explanation of the `subst` function.

'''

* Suppose you would like to vary the prerequisites according to the target,
  much as the variable \'``$@``' allows you to vary the recipe.
* You cannot do this with multiple targets in an ordinary rule, but you can do
  it with a static pattern rule.
* See Section 4.11 [Static Pattern Rules], page 40.
