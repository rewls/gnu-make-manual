= 10 Using Implicit Rules

* _Implicit rules_ tell `make` how to use customary techniques so that you do
  not have to specify them in detail when you want to use them.
* File names determine which implicit rules are run.

'''

* A chain of implicit rules can apply in sequence.
* See Section 10.4 [Chains of Implicit Rules].

'''

* The built-in implicit rules use several variables in their recipes so that, by
  chainging the values of the variables, you can change the way the implicit
  rule works.
** See Section 10.3 [Variables Used by Implicit Rules].

'''

* You can define your own implicit rules by writing pattern rules.
* See Section 10.5 [Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules].

'''

* _Suffix rules_ are a more limited way to define implicit rules.
* Pattern rules are more general and clearer, but suffix rules are retained for
  compatibility.
* See Section 10.7 [Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules].

== 10.1 Using Implicit Rules

* To allow `make` to find a customary method for updating a target file, all you
  have to do is refrain from specifying recipes yourself.
* Either write a rule with no recipe, or don't write a rule at all.
* Then `make` will figure out which kind of source file exists or can be made.

'''

* If an implicit rule is found, it can supply both a recipe and one or more
  prerequisites.
* You would want to write a rule for `foo.o` with no recipe if you need to specify
  additional prerequisites, such as header files, that the implicit rule cannot
  supply.

'''

* Each implicit rule has a target pattern and prerequisite patterns.
* There may be many implicit rules with the same target pattern.

'''

* Of course, when you write the makefile, you know which implicit rule you want
  make to use, and you know it will choose that one because you know which
  possible prerequisite files are supposed to exist.
* See Section 10.2 [Catalogue of Built-In Rules] for a catalogue of all the
  predefined implicit rules.

'''

* Above, we said an implicit rule applies if the required prerequisites “exist
  or can be made”.
* A file "can be made" if it is mentioned explicitly in the makefile as a target
  or a prerequisite, or if an implicit rule can be recursively found for how to
  make it.
* When an implicit prerequisite is the result of another implicit rule, we say
  that chaining is occurring.
* See Section 10.4 [Chains of Implicit Rules].

'''

* In general, `make` searches for an implicit rule for each target, and for each
  double-colon rule, that has no recipe.
* A file that is mentioned only as a prerequisite is considered a target whose
  rule specifies nothing, so implicit rule search happens for it.
* See Section 10.8 [Implicit Rule Search Algorithm], for the details of how the
  search is done.

'''

* Note that explicit prerequisites do not influence implicit rule search.

'''

* If you do not want an implicit rule to be used for a target that has no
  recipe, you can give that target an empty recipe by writing a semicolon (see
  Section 5.9 [Defining Empty Recipes]).

== 10.2 Catalogue of Built-In Rules

* Here is a catalogue of predefined implicit rules which are always available
  unless the makefile explicitly overrides or cancels them.

'''

* This manual only documents the default rules available on POSIX-based
  operating systems.

'''

Compiling C programs::
* `_n_.o` is made automatically from `_n_.c` with a recipe of the form \'``$(CC)
  $(CPPFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -f``'.

Assembling and preprocessing assembler programs::
* `_n_.o` is made automatically from `_n_.s` by running the assembler, `as`.
* The precise recipe is \'``$(AS) $(ASFLAGS)``'.
+
'''
* `_n_.s` is made automatically from `_n_.S` by running the C preprocessor,
  `cpp`.
* The precise recipe is \'``$(CPP) $(CPPFLAGS)``'.

Linking a single object file::
* `_n_` is made automatically from `_n_.o` by running the C compiler to link the
  program.
* The precise recipe used is \'``$(CC) $(LDFLAGS) _n_.o $(LOADLIBES) $(LDLIBS)``'.
+
'''
* This rule does the right thing for a simple program with only one source file.
* It will also do the right thing if there are multiple object files, one of
  which has a name matching that of the executable file.
* Thus,
+
[source,Makefile]
x: y.o z.o
+
when `x.c`, `y.c` and `z.c` all exist will execute:
+
[source,Makefile]
cc -c x.c -o x.o
cc -c y.c -o y.o
cc -c z.c -o z.o
cc x.o y.o z.o -o x
rm -f x.o
rm -f y.o
rm -f z.o

* In more complicated cases, such as when there is no object file whose name
  derives from the executable file name, you must write an explicit recipe for
  linking.
+
'''
* Each kind of file automatically made into \'``.o``' object files will be
  automatically linked by using the compiler (\'``$(CC)``', \'``$(FC)``' or
  \'``$(PC)``'; the C compiler \'``$(CC)``' is used to assemble \'``.s``' files)
  without the \'``-c``' option.
* This could be done by using the \'``.o``' object files as intermediates, but
  it is faster to do the compiling and linking in one step, so that's how it's
  done.

'''

* Every rule that produces an object file uses the variable `OUTPUT_OPTION`.
* `make` defines this variable either to contain \'``-o $@``', or to be empty,
  depending on a compile-time option.
* You need the \'``-o``' option to ensure that the output goes into the right
  file when the source file is in a different directory, as when using `VPATH`
  (see Section 4.4 [Directory Search]). 

== 10.3 Variables Used by Implicit Rules

* The recipes in built-in implicit rules make liberal use of certain predefined
  variables.
* You can alter the values of these variables in the makefile, with arguments to
  `make`, or in the environment to alter how the implicit rules work without
  redefining the rules themselves.

'''

* The variables used in implicit rules fall into two classes: those that are
  names of programs and those that contain arguments for the programs.
* If a variable value contains more than one argument, separate them with spaces.
* (The "name of a program" may also contain some command arguments, but it must
  start with an actual executable program name.)
* If a variable value contains more than one argument, separate them with
  spaces.

'''

* The following tables describe of some of the more commonly-used predefined
  variables.
* This list is not exhaustive, and the default values shown here may not be what
  `make` selects for your environment.
* To see the complete list of predefined variables for your instance of GNU
  `make` you can run \'``make -p``' in a directory with no makefiles.

'''

* Here is a table of some of the more common variables used as names of programs
  in built-in rules:
+
[%autowidth,cols="h,d"]
|===
|`AR`	|Archive-maintaining program; default \'``ar``'.
|`CC`	|Program for compiling C programs; default \'``cc``'.
|`CPP`	|
Program for running the C preprocessor, with results to standard output; default
\'``$(CC) -E``'.
|`RM`	|Command to remove a file; default \'``rm -f``'.
|===

'''

* Here is a table of variables whose values are additional arguments for the
  programs above.
* The default values for all of these is the empty string, unless otherwise
  noted.
+
[%autowidth,cols="h,a"]
|===
|`ARFLAGS`	|Flags to give the archive-maintaining program; default \'``rv``'.
|`CFLAGS`	|Extra flags to give to the C compiler.
|`CPPFLAGS`	|
Extra flags to give the C preprocessor and programs that use it.
|`LDFLAGS`	|
* Extra flags to give to compilers when they are supposed to invoke the linker,
  \'``ld``', such as `-L`.
* Libraries (`-lfoo`) should be added to the `LDLIBS` variable instead.
|`LDLIBS`	|
* Library flags or names given to compilers when they are supposed to invoke the
  linker, \'``ld``'.
* `LOADLIBES` is a deprecated alternative to `LDLIBS`.
* Non-library linker flags should go in the `LDFLAGS` variable.
|===

== 10.4 Chains of Implicit Rules

* Sometimes a file can be made by a sequence of implicit rules.
* For example, a file `_n_.o` could be made from `_n_.y` by running first Yacc
  and then `cc`.
* Such a sequence is called a _chain_.

'''

* If the file `_n_.c` exists, or is mentioned in the makefile, no special
  searching is required: `make` finds that the object file can be made by C
  compilation from `_n_.c`; later on, when considering how to make `_n_.c, the
  rule for running Yacc is used.
* Ultimately both `_n_.c` and `_n_.o` are updated.

'''

* However, even if `_n_.c` does not exist and is not mentioned, `make` knows
  how to envision it as the missing link between `_n_.o` and `_n_.y`!
* In this case, `_n_.c` is called an _intermediate file_.
* Once `make` has decided to use the intermediate file, it is entered in the
  data base as if it had been mentioned in the makefile, along with the
  implicit rule that says how to create it.

'''

* Intermediate files are remade using their rules just like all other files.
* But intermediate files are treated differently in two ways.

'''

* The first difference is what happens if the intermediate file does not
  exist.
* If an ordinary file _b_ does not exist, and `make` consider a target that
  depends on _b_, it invariably creates _b_ and then updates the target from
  _b_.
* But if _b_ is an intermediate file, then `make` can leave well enough alone:
  it won't create _b_ unless one of its prerequisites is out of date.
* This means the target depending on _b_ won't be rebuilt either, unless there
  is some other reason to update that target: for example the target doesn't
  exist or a different prerequisite is newer than the target.

'''

* The second difference is that if `make` _does_ create _b_ in order to update
  something else, it deletes _b_ later on after it is no longer needed.
* Therefore, an intermediate file which did not exist before `make` also does
  not exist after `make`.
* `make` reports the deletion to you by printing a \'``rm``' command showing
  which file it is deleting.

'''

* You can explicitly mark a file as intermediate by listing it as a
  prerequisite of the special target `.INTERMEDIATE`.
* This takes effect even if the file is mentioned explicitly in some other
  way.

'''

* A file cannot be intermediate if it is mentioned in the makefile as a target
  or prerequisite, so one way to avoid the deletion of intermediate files is
  by adding it as a prerequisite to rules.
* However, doing so can cause `make` to do extra work when searching pattern
  rules (see Section 10.8 [Implicit Rule Search Algorithm], page 137).

'''

* As an alternative, listing a file as a prerequisite of the special target
  `.NOTINTERMEDIATE` forces it to not be considered intermediate (just as any
  other mention of the file will do).
* Also, listing the target pattern of a pattern rule as a prerequisite of
  `.NOTINTERMEDIATE` ensures that no targets generated using that pattern rule
  are considered intermediate.

'''

* You can disable intermediate files completely in your makefile by providing
  `.NOTINTERMEDIATE` as a target with no prerequisites: in that case it
  applies to every file in the makefile.

'''

* If you do not want `make` to create a file merely because it does not
  already exist, but you also do not want make to automatically delete the
  file, you can mark it as a secondary file.
* To do this, list it as a prerequisite of the special target `.SECONDARY`.
* Marking a file as secondary also marks it as intermediate.

'''

* A chain can involve more than two implicit rules.
* For example, it is possible to make a file `foo` from `RCS/foo.y,v` by
  running RCS, Yacc and cc.
* Then both `foo.y` and `foo.c` are intermediate files that are deleted at the
  end.

'''

* No single implicit rule can appear more than once in a chain.
* This means that `make` will not even consider such a ridiculous thing as
  making `foo` from `foo.o.o` by running the linker twice.
* This constraint has the added benefit of preventing any infinite loop in the
  search for an implicit rule chain.

'''

* There are some special implicit rules to optimize certain cases that would
  otherwise be handled by rule chains.
* For example, making `foo` from `foo.c` could be handled by compiling and
  linking with separate chained rules, using `foo.o` as an intermediate file.
* But what actually happens is that a special rule for this case does the
  compilation and linking with a single `cc` command.
* The optimized rule is used in preference to the step-by-step chain because
  it comes earlier in the ordering of rules.

'''

* Finally, for performance reasons `make` will not consider non-terminal
  match-anything rules (i.e., \'``%:``') when searching for a rule to build a
  prerequisite of an implicit rule (see Section 10.5.5 [Match-Anything Rules],
  page 134).

== 10.5 Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules

* You define an implicit rule by writing a _pattern rule_.
* A pattern rule looks like an ordinary rule, except that its target contains
  the character \'``%``'.
* The target is considered a pattern for matching file names; the \'``%``' can
  match any nonempty substring, while other characters match only themselves.
* The prerequisites likewise use \'``%``' to show how their names relate to
  the target name.

'''

* Thus, a pattern rule \'``%.o : %.c``' says how to make any file `_stem_.o`
  from another file `_stem_.c`.

'''

* Note that expansion using \'``%``' in pattern rules occurs *after* any
  variable or function expansions, which take place when the makefile is read.
* See Chapter 6 [How to Use Variables], page 65, and Chapter 8 [Functions for
  Transforming Text], page 91.

=== 10.5.1 Introduction to Pattern Rules

* A pattern rule contains the character \'``%``' (exactly one of them) in the
  target; otherwise, it looks exactly like an ordinary rule.
* The target is a pattern for matching file names; the \'``%``' matches any
  nonempty substring, while other characters match only themselves.

'''

* For example, \'``%.c``' as a pattern matches any file name that ends in
  \'``.c``'. \'``s.%.c``' as a pattern matches any file name that starts with
  \'``s.``', ends in \'``.c``' and is at least five characters long.
* (There must be at least one character to match the \'``%``'.)
* The substring that the \'``%``' matches is called the _stem_.

'''

* \'``%``' in a prerequisite of a pattern rule stands for the same stem that
  was matched by the \'``%``' in the target.
* In order for the pattern rule to apply, its target pattern must match the
  file name under consideration and all of its prerequisites (after pattern
  substitution) must name files that exist or can be made.
* These files become prerequisites of the target.

'''

* Thus, a rule of the form
+
[source,makefile,subs="quotes"]
%.o : %.c ; _recipe_...
+
specifies how to make a file `_n_.o`, with another file `_n_.c` as its
prerequisite, provided that `_n_.c` exists or can be made.

'''

* There may also be prerequisites that do not use \'``%``'; such a
  prerequisite attaches to every file made by this pattern rule.
* These unvarying prerequisites are useful occasionally.

''''

* A pattern rule need not have any prerequisites that contain ‘%’, or in fact any prerequisites at all.
* Such a rule is effectively a general wildcard.
* It provides a way to make any file that matches the target pattern.
* See Section 10.6 [Last Resort], page 135.

'''

* More than one pattern rule may match a target.
* In this case make will choose the “best fit” rule.
* See Section 10.5.4 [How Patterns Match], page 133.

'''

* Pattern rules may have more than one target; however, every target must
  contain a `%` character.
* Multiple target patterns in pattern rules are always treated as grouped
  targets (see Section 4.9 [Multiple Targets in a Rule], page 37) regardless
  of whether they use the `:` or `&:` separator.

'''

* There is one exception: if a pattern target is out of date or does not exist
  and the makefile does not need to build it, then it will not cause the other
  targets to be considered out of date.
* Note that this historical exception will be removed in future versions of
  GNU `make` and should not be relied on.
* If this situation is detected `make` will generate a warning _pattern recipe
  did not update peer target_; however, `make` cannot detect all such
  situations.
* Please be sure that your recipe updates _all_ the target patterns when it
  runs.

=== 10.5.3 Automatic Variables

* Suppose you are writing a pattern rule to compile a \'``.c``' file into a
  \'``.o``' file: how do you write the \'``cc``' command so that it operates
  on the right source file name?
* You cannot write the name in the recipe, because the name is different each
  time the implicit rule is applied.

'''

* What you do is use a special feature of `make`, the _automatic variables_.
* These variables have values computed afresh for each rule that is executed,
  based on the target and prerequisites of the rule.
* In this example, you would use \'``$@``' for the object file name and
  \'``$<``' for the source file name.

'''

* It's very important that you recognize the limited scope in which automatic
  variable values are available: they only have values within the recipe.
* In particular, you cannot use them anywhere within the target list of a
  rule; they have no value there and will expand to the empty string.
* Also, they cannot be accessed directly within the prerequisite list of a
  rule.
* A common mistake is attempting to use `$@` within the prerequisites list;
  this will not work.
* However, there is a special feature of GNU make, secondary expansion (see
  Section 3.9 [Secondary Expansion], page 19), which will allow automatic
  variable values to be used in prerequisite lists.

'''

* Here is a table of automatic variables:

'''

`$@`::
* The file name of the target of the rule.
* If the target is an archive member, then \'``$@``' is the name of the
  archive file.
* In a pattern rule that has multiple targets (see Section 10.5.1
  [Introduction to Pattern Rules], page 129), \'``$@``' is the name of
  whichever target caused the rule's recipe to be run.

`$%`::
* The target member name, when the target is an archive member.
* See Chapter 11 [Archives], page 139.
* For example, if the target is `foo.a(bar.o)` then `$%` is `bar.o` and `$@`
  is `foo.a`.
* `$%` is empty when the target is not an archive member.

`$?`::
* The names of all the prerequisites that are newer than the target, with
  spaces between them.
* If the target does not exist, all prerequisites will be included.
* For prerequisites which are archive members, only the named member is used
  (see Chapter 11 [Archives], page 139).
+
'''
* \'``$?`` is useful even in explicit rules when you wish to operate on only
  the prerequisites that have changed.
* For example, suppose that an archive named `lib` is supposed to contain
  copies of several object files.
* This rule copies just the changed object files into the archive:
+
[source,makefile]
lib: foo.o bar.o lose.o win.o
	ar r lib $?

`$^`::
* The names of all the prerequisites, with spaces between them.
* For prerequisites which are archive members, only the named member is used
  (see Chapter 11 [Archives], page 139).
* A target has only one prerequisite on each other file it depends on, no
  matter how many times each file is listed as a prerequisite.
* So if you list a prerequisite more than once for a target, the value of `$^`
  contains just one copy of the name.
* This list does not contain any of the order-only prerequisites; for those
  see the \'``$|``' variable, below.

'''

* Of the variables listed above, four have values that are single file names,
  and three have values that are lists of file names.
* These seven have variants that get just the file's directory name or just
  the file name within the directory.
* The variant variables' names are formed by appending `D` or `F`,
  respectively.
* The functions `dir` and `notdir` can be used to obtain a similar effect (see
  Section 8.3 [Functions for File Names], page 95).
* Note, however, that the `D` variants all omit the trailing slash which
  always appears in the output of the `dir` function.
* Here is a table of the variants:

'''

`$(%D)`::
`$(%F)`::
* The directory part and the file-within-directory part of the target archive
  member name.
* This makes sense only for archive member targets of the form
  `_archive_(_member_)` and is useful only when member may contain a directory
  name.
* (See Section 11.1 [Archive Members as Targets], page 139.)
