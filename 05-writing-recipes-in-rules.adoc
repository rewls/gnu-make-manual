= 5 Writing Recipes in Rules
:toc: left
:source-highlighter: rouge

* The recipe of a rule consists of one or more shell command lines to be
  executed, one at a time, in the order they appear.
* Recipes in makefiles are always interpreted by `/bin/sh` unless the makefile
  specifies otherwise.

== 5.2 Recipe Echoing

* Normally `make` prints each line of the recipe before it is executed.
* We call this _echoing_ because it gives the appearance that you are typing
  the lines yourself.

'''

* When a line starts with \'``@``', the echoing of that line is suppressed.
* The \'``@``' is discarded before the line is passed to the shell.
* Typically you would use this for a command whose only effect is to print
  something, such as an `echo` command to indicate progress through the
  makefile:
+
[source,makefile]
@echo About to make distribution files

'''

* When `make` is given the flag \'``-n``' or \'``--just-print``' it only
  echoes most recipes, without executing them.
* See Section 9.8 [Summary of Options].
* In this case even the recipe lines starting with \'``@``' are printed.
* This flag is useful for finding out which recipes `make` thinks are necessary
  without actually doing them.

'''

* The \'``-s``' or \'``--silent``' flag to make prevents all echoing, as if
  all recipes started with \'``@``'.
* A rule in the makefile for the special target `.SILENT` without
  prerequisites has the same effect (see Section 4.8 [Special Built-in Target
  Names]).

== 5.5 Errors in Recipes

* After each shell invocation returns, `make` looks at its exit status.
* If the shell completed successfully, the next line in the recipe is executed
  in a new shell.
* If there is an error, `make` gives up on the current rule, and perhaps on
  all rules.
* Sometimes the failure of a certain recipe does not indicate a problem.
* To ignore errors in a recipe line, write a \'``-``' at the beginning of the
  line's text.
* The \'``-``' is discarded before the line is passed to the shell for
  execution.

== 5.7 Recursive Use of `make`

* Recursive use of `make` means using `make` as a command in a makefile.
* This technique is useful when you want separate makefiles for various
  subsystems that compose a larger system.
* For example, suppose you have a sub-directory `subdir` which has its own
  makefile, and you would like the containing directory's makefile to run
  `make` on the sub-directory.
* You can do it by writing this:
+
[source,Makefile]
subsystem:
	cd subdir && $(MAKE)
+
or, equivalently, this (see Section 9.8 [Summary of Options], page 114):
+
[source,Makefile]
subsystem:
	$(MAKE) -C subdir

'''

* You can write recursive `make` commands just by copying this example, but
  there are many things to know about how they work and why, and about how the
  sub-`make` relates to the top-level `make`.
* You may also find it useful to declare targets that invoke recursive make
  commands as '`.PHONY`' (for more discussion on when this is useful, see
  Section 4.5 [Phony Targets], page 31).

'''

* For your convenience, when GNU `make` starts (after it has processed any
  `-C` options) it sets the variable `CURDIR` to the pathname of the current
  working directory.
* This value is never touched by `make` again: in particular note that if you
  include files from other directories the value of `CURDIR` does not change.
* The value has the same precedence it would have if it were set in the
  makefile (by default, an environment variable `CURDIR` will not override
  this value).
* Note that setting this variable has no impact on the operation of `make` (it
  does not cause `make` to change its working directory, for example).

=== 5.7.1 How the `MAKE` Variable Works

* Recursive `make` commands should always use the variable `MAKE`, not the
  explicit command name '`make`', as shown here:
+
[source,Makefile]
subsystem:
	cd subdir && $(MAKE)

'''

* The value of this variable is the file name with which `make` was invoked.
* If this file name was `/bin/make`, then the recipe executed is '`cd subdir &&
  /bin/make'`.
* If you use a special version of `make` to run the top-level makefile, the
  same special version will be executed for recursive invocations.

'''

* As a special feature, using the variable `MAKE` in the recipe of a rule
  alters the effects of the '`-t`' ('`--touch`'), '`-n`' ('`--just-print`'),
  or `'-q'` (`'--question'`) option.
* Using the `MAKE` variable has the same effect as using a '`+`' character at
  the beginning of the recipe line.
* See Section 9.3 [Instead of Executing the Recipes], page 111.
* This special feature is only enabled if the `MAKE` variable appears directly
  in the recipe: it does not apply if the `MAKE` variable is referenced
  through expansion of another variable.
* In the latter case you must use the '`+`' token to get these special
  effects.

'''

* Consider the command '`make -t`' in the above example.
* (The '`-t`' option marks targets as up to date without actually running any
  recipes; see Section 9.3 [Instead of Execution], page 111.)
* Following the usual definition of '`-t`', a '`make -t`' command in the
  example would create a file named `subsystem` and do nothing else.
* What you really want it to do is run '`cd subdir && make -t`'; but that would
  require executing the recipe, and '`-t`' says not to execute recipes.

'''

* The special feature makes this do what you want: whenever a recipe line of a
  rule contains the variable `MAKE`, the flags '`-t`', '`-n`' and '`-q`' do
  not apply to that line.
* Recipe lines containing `MAKE` are executed normally despite the presence of
  a flag that causes most recipes not to be run.
* The usual `MAKEFLAGS` mechanism passes the flags to the sub-`make` (see
  Section 5.7.3 [Communicating Options to a Sub-make], page 59), so your
  request to touch the files, or print the recipes, is propagated to the
  subsystem.
