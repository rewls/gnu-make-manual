= 5 Writing Recipes in Rules
:toc: left
:source-highlighter: rouge

* The recipe of a rule consists of one or more shell command lines to be
  executed, one at a time, in the order they appear.
* Recipes in makefiles are always interpreted by `/bin/sh` unless the makefile
  specifies otherwise.

== 5.2 Recipe Echoing

* Normally `make` prints each line of the recipe before it is executed.
* We call this _echoing_ because it gives the appearance that you are typing
  the lines yourself.

'''

* When a line starts with \'``@``', the echoing of that line is suppressed.
* The \'``@``' is discarded before the line is passed to the shell.
* Typically you would use this for a command whose only effect is to print
  something, such as an `echo` command to indicate progress through the
  makefile:
+
[source,makefile]
@echo About to make distribution files

'''

* When `make` is given the flag \'``-n``' or \'``--just-print``' it only
  echoes most recipes, without executing them.
* See Section 9.8 [Summary of Options].
* In this case even the recipe lines starting with \'``@``' are printed.
* This flag is useful for finding out which recipes `make` thinks are necessary
  without actually doing them.

'''

* The \'``-s``' or \'``--silent``' flag to make prevents all echoing, as if
  all recipes started with \'``@``'.
* A rule in the makefile for the special target `.SILENT` without
  prerequisites has the same effect (see Section 4.8 [Special Built-in Target
  Names]).

== 5.5 Errors in Recipes

* After each shell invocation returns, `make` looks at its exit status.
* If the shell completed successfully, the next line in the recipe is executed
  in a new shell.
* If there is an error, `make` gives up on the current rule, and perhaps on
  all rules.
* Sometimes the failure of a certain recipe does not indicate a problem.
* To ignore errors in a recipe line, write a \'``-``' at the beginning of the
  line's text.
* The \'``-``' is discarded before the line is passed to the shell for
  execution.
