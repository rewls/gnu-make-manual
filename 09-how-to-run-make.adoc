= 9 How to Run make

* A makefile that says how to recompile a program can be used in more than one
  way.
* The simplest use is to recompile every file that is out of date.
* Usually, makefiles are written so that if you run make with no arguments, it
  does just that.

'''

* But you might want to update only some of the files; you might want to use a
  different compiler or different compiler options; you might want just to
  find out which files are out of date without changing them.

'''

* By giving arguments when you run `make`, you can do any of these things and
  many others.

'''

* The exit status of `make` is always one of three values:

'''

`0`::
* The exit status is zero if `make` is successful.

`2`::
* The exit status is two if `make` encounters any errors.
* It will print messages describing the particular errors.

`1`::
* The exit status is one if you use the \'``-q``' flag and `make` determines
  that some target is not already up to date.
* See Section 9.3 [Instead of Executing Recipes], page 111.

== 9.1 Arguments to Specify the Makefile

* The way to specify the name of the makefile is with the \'``-f``' or
  \'``--file``' option (\'``--makefile``' also works).
* For example, \'``-f altmake``' says to use the file `altmake` as the
  makefile.

'''

* If you use the \'``-f``' flag several times and follow each \'``-f``' with an
  argument, all the specified files are used jointly as makefiles.

'''

* If you do not use the \'``-f``' or \'``--file``' flag, the default is to try
  `GNUmakefile`, `makefile`, and `Makefile`, in that order, and use the first
  of these three which exists or can be made (see Chapter 3 [Writing
  Makefiles], page 11).
