= 9 How to Run make

* A makefile that says how to recompile a program can be used in more than one
  way.
* The simplest use is to recompile every file that is out of date.
* Usually, makefiles are written so that if you run make with no arguments, it
  does just that.

'''

* But you might want to update only some of the files; you might want to use a
  different compiler or different compiler options; you might want just to
  find out which files are out of date without changing them.

'''

* By giving arguments when you run `make`, you can do any of these things and
  many others.

'''

* The exit status of `make` is always one of three values:

'''

`0`::
* The exit status is zero if `make` is successful.

`2`::
* The exit status is two if `make` encounters any errors.
* It will print messages describing the particular errors.

`1`::
* The exit status is one if you use the \'``-q``' flag and `make` determines
  that some target is not already up to date.
* See Section 9.3 [Instead of Executing Recipes], page 111.

== 9.1 Arguments to Specify the Makefile

* The way to specify the name of the makefile is with the \'``-f``' or
  \'``--file``' option (\'``--makefile``' also works).
* For example, \'``-f altmake``' says to use the file `altmake` as the
  makefile.

'''

* If you use the \'``-f``' flag several times and follow each \'``-f``' with an
  argument, all the specified files are used jointly as makefiles.

'''

* If you do not use the \'``-f``' or \'``--file``' flag, the default is to try
  `GNUmakefile`, `makefile`, and `Makefile`, in that order, and use the first
  of these three which exists or can be made (see Chapter 3 [Writing
  Makefiles], page 11).

== 9.2 Arguments to Specify the Goals

* The goals are the targets that make should strive ultimately to update.
* Other targets are updated as well if they appear as prerequisites of goals,
  or prerequisites of prerequisites of goals, etc.

'''

* By default, the goal is the first target in the makefile (not counting
  targets that start with a period).
* Therefore, makefiles are usually written so that the first target is for
  compiling the entire program or programs they describe.
* If the first rule in the makefile has several targets, only the first target
  in the rule becomes the default goal, not the whole list.
* You can manage the selection of the default goal from within your makefile
  using the `.DEFAULT_GOAL` variable (see Section 6.14 [Other Special
  Variables], page 80).

'''

* You can also specify a different goal or goals with command line arguments
  to `make`.
* Use the name of the goal as an argument.
* If you specify several goals, `make` processes each of them in turn, in the
  order you name them.

'''

* Any target in the makefile may be specified as a goal (unless it starts with
  \'``-`' or contains an \'``=``', in which case it will be parsed as a switch
  or variable definition, respectively).
* Even targets not in the makefile may be specified, if `make` can find implicit
  rules that say how to make them.

'''

* `Make` will set the special variable `MAKECMDGOALS` to the list of goals you
  specified on the command line.
* If no goals were given on the command line, this variable is empty.
* Note that this variable should be used only in special circumstances.

'''

* An example of appropriate use is to avoid including `.d` files during
  `clean` rules (see Section 4.13 [Automatic Prerequisites], page 42), so
  `make` won't create them only to immediately remove them again:

[source,makefile]
----
sources = foo.c bar.c

ifeq (,$(filter clean,$(MAKECMDGOALS)))
include $(sources:.c=.d)
endif
----

* One use of specifying a goal is if you want to compile only a part of the
  program, or only one of several programs.
* Specify as a goal each file that you wish to remake.
* For example, consider a directory containing several programs, with a
  makefile that starts like this:

[source,makefile]
.PHONY: all
all: size nm ld ar as

* If you are working on the program `size`, you might want to say \'``make
  size``' so that only the files of that program are recompiled.
* Another use of specifying a goal is to make files that are not normally
  made.
* For example, there may be a file of debugging output, or a version of the
  program that is compiled specially for testing, which has a rule in the
  makefile but is not a prerequisite of the default goal.

'''

* Another use of specifying a goal is to run the recipe associated with a
  phony target (see Section 4.5 [Phony Targets], page 31) or empty target (see
  Section 4.7 [Empty Target Files to Record Events], page 34).
* Many makefiles contain a phony target named `clean` which deletes everything
  except source files.
* Naturally, this is done only if you request it explicitly with \'``make
  clean``'.
* Following is a list of typical phony and empty target names.
* See Section 16.6 [Standard Targets], page 171, for a detailed list of all
  the standard target names which GNU software packages use.

'''

`all`::
* Make all the top-level targets the makefile knows about.

`clean`::
* Delete all files that are normally created by running `make`.

`mostlyclean`::
* Like \'``clean``', but may refrain from deleting a few files that people
  normally don't want to recompile.
* For example, the \'``mostlyclean``' target for GCC does not delete
  `libgcc.a`, because recompiling it is rarely necessary and takes a lot
  of time.

`distclean`
`realclean`
`clobber`::
* Any of these targets might be defined to delete _more_ files than
  \'``clean``' does.
* For example, this would delete configuration files or links that you would
  normally create as preparation for compilation, even if the makefile itself
  cannot create these files.

`install`::
* Copy the executable file into a directory that users typically search for
  commands; copy any auxiliary files that the executable uses into the
  directories where it will look for them.

`print`::
* Print listings of the source files that have changed.

`tar`::
* Create a tar file of the source files.

`shar`::
* Create a shell archive (shar file) of the source files.

`dist`::
* Create a distribution file of the source files.
* This might be a tar file, or a shar file, or a compressed version of one of
  the above, or even more than one of the above.

`TAGS`::
* Update a tags table for this program.

`check`::
`test`::
* Perform self tests on the program this makefile builds.

== 9.5 Overriding Variables

* An argument that contains \'``=``' specifies the value of a variable:
  \'``_v_=_x_``' sets the value of the variable _v_ to _x_.
* If you specify a value in this way, all ordinary assignments of the same
  variable in the makefile are ignored; we say they have been overridden by
  the command line argument.

'''

* The most common way to use this facility is to pass extra flags to
  compilers.
* For example, in a properly written makefile, the variable `CFLAGS` is
  included in each recipe that runs the C compiler, so a file `foo.c` would be
  compiled something like this:

....
cc -c $(CFLAGS) foo.c
....


'''

* Thus, whatever value you set for `CFLAGS` affects each compilation that
  occurs.
* The makefile probably specifies the usual value for `CFLAGS`, like this:

[source,makefile]
CFLAGS=-g

* Each time you run `make`, you can override this value if you wish.
* For example, if you say \'``make CFLAGS='-g -O'``', each C compilation will
  be done with \'``cc -c -g -O``'.
* (This also illustrates how you can use quoting in the shell to enclose
  spaces and other special characters in the value of a variable when you
  override it.)

'''

* The variable `CFLAGS` is only one of many standard variables that exist just
  so that you can change them this way.
* See Section 10.3 [Variables Used by Implicit Rules], page 125, for a
  complete list.

'''

* You can also program the makefile to look at additional variables of your
  own, giving the user the ability to control other aspects of how the
  makefile works by changing the variables.

'''

* When you override a variable with a command line argument, you can define
  either a recursively-expanded variable or a simply-expanded variable.
* The examples shown above make a recursively-expanded variable; to make a
  simply-expanded variable, write \'``:=``' or \'``::=``' instead of \'``=``'.
* But, unless you want to include a variable reference or function call in the
  value that you specify, it makes no difference which kind of variable you
  create.

'''

* There is one way that the makefile can change a variable that you have
  overridden.
* This is to use the override directive, which is a line that looks like this:
  \'``override variable = value``' (see Section 6.7 [The override Directive],
  page 75).
